  "phase": 5,
  "step": 2,
  "name": "Remove VS Code hardcoded launch",
  "description": "Remove the hardcoded 'code .' command that breaks headless automation. This is a breaking change documented in the architecture.",
  "motivation": "Remove IDE auto-launch for CI/CD and agent compatibility. Hardcoded IDE launch prevents headless execution and is incompatible with automation workflows.",
  "context": {
    "files_to_read": [
      "hooks/post_gen_project.py (contains run_command(\"code .\") on line 60)",
      "docs/architecture/architecture.md"
    ],
    "files_to_modify": [
      "hooks/post_gen_project.py"
    ],
    "files_to_create": [],
    "prerequisites": [
      "Step 05-01 completed (main if __name__ orchestration exists)",
      "Current file structure intact with git operations in place"
    ],
    "reference_documents": [
      "docs/architecture/architecture.md - Section 4.2 (IDE Launcher Module design)"
    ],
    "breaking_change_info": "IDE opening will be parameterized in US-003 via 'open_ide' parameter. This step removes hardcoded IDE launch to enable CI/CD and headless execution. Users who want IDE opening will use: cookiecutter --extra-context=open_ide=vscode",
    "execution_context": "This is a refactoring step to support headless execution. Line 60 (run_command(\"code .\")) must be deleted entirely. All other code remains unchanged."
  },
  "instructions": [
    "1. Open hooks/post_gen_project.py and locate the line with 'code .'",
    "   - Current state: run_command(\"code .\") appears on line 60",
    "   - This command launches VS Code after git initialization",
    "",
    "2. Remove the entire line containing run_command(\"code .\"):",
    "   - Delete: run_command(\"code .\")",
    "   - Keep the print statements before and after",
    "",
    "3. Verify the end of the file now looks like:",
    "   ```python",
    "   print(\"👨🏻‍💻 time to code!\")",
    "   # No run_command(\\\"code .\\\") here",
    "   ",
    "   print(\"👋🏿 bye bye! 🐍\")",
    "   ```",
    "",
    "4. Verify no 'code .' command exists in the file:",
    "   grep -c 'code \\.' hooks/post_gen_project.py || echo '0'",
    "   (Expected output: 0)",
    "",
    "5. Verify Python syntax is valid and import works:",
    "   python -c \"import ast; ast.parse(open('hooks/post_gen_project.py').read()); print('✓ Syntax valid')\"",
    "",
    "6. Verify unit tests still pass (headless execution validation):",
    "   pipenv run pytest tests/unit/test_git_detection.py -v",
    "   (Expect all tests to pass - no IDE launch required for tests)"
  ],
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "The line containing run_command(\"code .\") is completely removed from hooks/post_gen_project.py",
    "No 'code .' substring exists anywhere in the file (verified by grep returning 0)",
    "Print statement 'time to code!' remains in the file (line 59)",
    "Print statement 'bye bye! 🐍' remains in the file (line 62)",
    "Python syntax is valid and module can be imported",
    "All unit tests pass without IDE launch side effects",
    "Script is suitable for headless/CI execution (no subprocess attempts to open IDE)"
  ],
  "verification": {
    "command": "grep -c 'code \\.' hooks/post_gen_project.py",
